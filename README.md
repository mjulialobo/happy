<p> Next Level Week is a free online event produced by Rocketseat. For 5 days, a teacher shows how to build a complete application from scratch.
The NLW 3 proposal is an application in which orphanages can register, and people can schedule visits to play with the children. </p>

<p> I decided to turn Happy into a dog Shelter platform that will bring people together with their future best animal friends. People looking for pets can search for
shelters close to them and shelters can register themselves.
